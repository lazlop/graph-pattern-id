    "1. Start with b-schema graph size 0, add a node from data graph\n",
    "    - If first step, add a random triple. All subsequent steps, add a node connected to graph, following a triple that is not represented by the b-schema, and add all triples connecting this node to the b-schema. \n",

    "Another statistical algorithm could just be turning the whole graph into a query, but limiting the results to 1, then running the query many times (would need some statistical measure of enough times). Then we could just say that all the things in a column together are in the same group, and say some columns are equivalent to build the schema. \n",

    "Issue with implementation, doesn't properly translate graph into query. Adding triples to schema but they're not getting represented. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm doesn't seem to work. After a certain point, adding triples to the representation isn't increaseing the amount of triples represented by the query. perhaps at this point, adding another triple kicks out another triple to represent. My thinking was that the amount of triples represented would be monotonic, but if this is what's happening, then that isn't true. Perhaps this is also part of me having a limit in the query - at each step some triples will not be represented by the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can try collecting results using limit 1 and offset to sample, or using filter not equals to make sure I don't get multiple of the same results if not necessary. These approaches miss some triples. There may be a way to get the use of filters to work, but I can't think of a generalizable way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can try and theorize about what most building systems look like (maybe a tree structure with some duplication from branch to branch) and try to have an algorithm that runs faster for graphs like this. Not thinking of a good way of avoiding collecting all the sparql results if I want a truly generalized approach. For specializing to certain kinds of structures, algorithms involve some guess and check. like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) add a node from the data graph\n",
    "2) Invert into a query and run with limit 1 \n",
    "3) Add a round of filter constraints for all results returned, and run the query again, ensuring there was no replication \n",
    "4) Optional step to consider: Add filters until there are no more results. Once there are no more results, change one of the last rounds of filters and collectg more results. I think this will not be helpfully so probably wouldn't implement\n",
    "5) Select a new triple. This triple can be any not represented by the b-schema, but would preferably be one attached to the b-schema. Match it to existing triples in the b-schema Use BIND or filter with a SPARQL query to see if it is already represented by anything in the b-schema. If it is, added it to the set of triples represented by the CURRENT b-schema. Repeat this step until a new node has to be added to the data graph that is not represented, then rerun other steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm assumes a structure that is interconnected with several parallel paths, and the filter not equals will reduce redundant triples while limiting increase in the query size. And it assumes we can get a pretty close to complete b-schema by representing individual blocks, then can just check the rest of the graph against the b-schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can also do a certain amount of binds based on the amount of instances of that class in the graph. This may help flesh out branches of the graph more before iterating through individual triples. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also probably faster to check if a node is in the b-schema than to generate a new query and run again. However, running the queries with limit 1 can still take some time. It's also faster to run queries that are connected, so keeping the b-schema connected is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also may want to add nodes and add all relations conecting the nodes, since I could end up with weird duplicate structures in the graph if I do not do this. It adds some complexity so will skip for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "S223 is also harder, because there are parallel paths of connectivity, and some skipping of nodes in the connection statements. I think for s223, we must add all triples connecting two nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So new algorithm:\n",
    "1. Start with b-schema graph size 0, add a triple or set of triples with the same subject and object from data graph to the b-schema\n",
    "    - If first step, add a random triple. If there are other triples with the same subject and object, add all of these triples. All subsequent steps, add a triple connected to the existing b-schema, but not currently represented by the b-schema. \n",
    "2. Based on the classes and relations of the new triples, find a candidate statement in the b-schema that may represent this triple. \n",
    "3. Invert the b-schema statements to SPARQL queries with the class and relation information. \n",
    "4. Iteratively run queries with limit one with the identity of the added triple bound to the candidate statements.\n",
    "    -  If one of these queries succeeds, the new triple should be added to the list of triples represented by a statement in the b-schema. \n",
    "    - If none of these queries succed, add the new triple to the b-schema as a new statement \n",
    "5. If all triples are represented, end the process, otherwise, repeat the process. "
