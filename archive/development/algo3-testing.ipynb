    "# Create Approximate Schema\n",
    "1. Start with b-schema graph size 0, select a triple from data graph \n",
    "    - If first step, add a random triple. All subsequent steps, select a triple connected to the existing b-schema, but not currently represented by the b-schema. \n",
    "2. Using a parameter for amount of hops (with default value of 1) create the graph around this triple. \n",
    "3. Generate a class graph for this mini graph.\n",
    "4. Query the b-schema against the b-schema for this graph to see if it is already represented by the b-schema.\n",
    "5. If this query fails, find which statements in the mini b-schema were not represented by the main b-schema. Add these statements to the b-schema.\n",
    "6. This will create an approximate b-schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify schema \n",
    "1. Iterate through each triple \n",
    "2. Based on the classes and relations of the new triples, find a candidate statement in the b-schema that may represent this triple. \n",
    "3. Invert the b-schema statements to SPARQL queries with the class and relation information. \n",
    "4. Iteratively run queries with limit one with the identity of the added triple bound to the candidate statements.\n",
    "    -  If one of these queries succeeds, the new triple should be added to the list of triples represented by a statement in the b-schema. \n",
    "5. If all triples are represented, end the process\n",
    "6. Will need to remove instances represented by a certain part of the summary if they're also represented by another part of the summary. e.g. the vavs will all have an ask true result when bound to vav-cooling-only. However, the only the ones not judged true for VAV with reheat should be linked in that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Status\n",
    "- Still haven't quite made the b-schema\n",
    "- The class graph is what algo2 ended up producing pretty much, and it is a useful summary that can be quickly constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe can do the following: \n",
    "- start from the nodes in the b-schema. \n",
    " - First, see if there are any triples between nodes in the b-schema not already represented. This covers the case where individual classes in the class graph map to multiple instances\n",
    " - Then, starting from the nodes in the b-schema, test one hop around each of them. \n",
    " If the one hop doesn't work, add triples from the one hop graph that don't appear in the b-schema (maybe based on class, but triple ordering is consistent/deterministic, this is not necessary). \n",
    "\n",
    " e.g. lets say we test the vav with reheat. First pass we would find that there is a missing feeds relationship from the ahu to the vav with reheat. Then we would construct the one hop query and it would fail. We could then see which triples are in the one hop graph and not the b-schema and we can add those. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the b-schema for brick correctly. 223P not working correctly for a couple reasons. 1) There are some connection points 2 hops away from anything else (I think). These aren't getting matched to something valid in the b-schema. 2) Properties aren't getting properly distinguished from each other. May be because the hasAspect information isn't included in the query for some reason. However, hasAspect is showing up on other things. only one property showing up on AHU but there should be many\n",
    "\n",
    "Point 2 is easier to address than point 1. However, point 1 wouldn't affect fully valid 223P models (with all connection points connected). If there are lots of junctions in some models I can see it causing issues with my 1 hop subgraph approach. Could add temporary relations for inferencing (which is a common OWL thing to do I think). "
