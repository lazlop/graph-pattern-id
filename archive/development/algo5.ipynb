    "Changing approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct approaches to create bschema have too many compromises and aren't working generically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should change approaches to use one hop graph queries and LLMs to do new class names, then can just create a class graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also has more interpretability than the bschema, where you still had to inspect the graph to learn what something is, instead of just looking at a human readable label. \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of iterations of naming things based on their one hop graphs should also work for different schema or types of graphs so it is somewhat manual but also can be generalized. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. can go through and create ask queries for each thing, then run the ask query on each node and see which node matches which query. Ask queries are pretty fast so this is probably faster than option 2. However, since ask queries will be correct for a subset of the query (i.e., they won't catch if there's MORE information for a given thing) this will require some correction at the end. Will essentially have to remove the vav-cooling-only label from vavs with reheat based on the fact that all vavs with reheat are also vav-cooling-only, so we can remove this. Can alternatively generate two sparql queries and test both directions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Can go through and check if class graphs are isomorphic for each thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then need to build the inferred class label. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLM class naming isn't particularly good using a locally running LLM. Should just number the variants of the original class. (ConnectionPoint1,2, VAV1,2, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using GPT OSS run by CBORG, creating new class names was decent\n",
    "\n",
    "# TODO: \n",
    "- works right for brick, but class graph currently only contains one class. This may create bugs, so I will need to consider other methods. Working so far because it happens to gets the most recently added class, which is alphabetically the latest because of the version tag I'm adding. Instead of directly doing the class relations it may make sense to separate instance and class once again \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix how I'm getting aspects and named nodes again so these show up in class graph for isomorphism. "
