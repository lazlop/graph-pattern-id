# Graph Pattern Identification for RDF Models of Buildings

Doing some subgraph mining/subgraph discovery to condense graph semantic models of buildings. 

TODO: Investigate something like https://github.com/p3et/dmgm for this purpose

With graph representation, demonstrate some querying. Maybe use rdf:Seq for groups so you can still answer queries over the graph.
