# Graph Pattern Identification for RDF Models of Buildings

Doing some subgraph mining/subgraph discovery to condense graph semantic models of buildings. 

TODO: Investigate something like https://github.com/p3et/dmgm for this purpose

With graph representation, demonstrate some querying. Maybe use rdf:Seq for groups so you can still answer queries over the graph. 



Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. 

This project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting. To format your code, run:

```bash
uv run --with dev black .
```
