    "1. Start with b-schema graph size 0, select a triple from data graph \n",
    "    - If first step, add a random triple. All subsequent steps, select a triple connected to the existing b-schema, but not currently represented by the b-schema. \n",
    "2. Using a parameter for amount of hops (with default value of 1) create the graph around this triple. \n",
    "3. Generate a class graph for this mini graph.\n",
    "4. Query the b-schema against the b-schema for this graph to see if it is already represented by the b-schema.\n",
    "5. If this query fails, find which statements in the mini b-schema were not represented by the main b-schema. Add these statements to the b-schema.\n",

    "2. Based on the classes and relations of the new triples, find a candidate statement in the b-schema that may represent this triple. \n",
    "3. Invert the b-schema statements to SPARQL queries with the class and relation information. \n",
    "4. Iteratively run queries with limit one with the identity of the added triple bound to the candidate statements.\n",
    "    -  If one of these queries succeeds, the new triple should be added to the list of triples represented by a statement in the b-schema. \n",
