""" 
Compressing a graph by putting nodes into groups and doing group-to-group relationships. 
Going to have 2 or 3 groups with 1-to-1 relationships, 1-to-all relationships, and all-to-all relationships

Maybe not 1-to-1, 1-to-all, all-to-all, but creating groups within groups. 
Everything maintains their own identity but the groups are super imposed. 

Lets start just with cnx and see what happens, or maybe try a tree structure containment? 

If groups contain groups, everything can be 1-to-all (or each to all) 
this each to all doesn't seem to be very helpful, since it will just replicate the tree structure 
and doesn't bring together separate branches of tree
it won't "fold" the tree, which I would like to do. 

Maybe I try and create groups by walking the graph.
Start with all things of a certain type in a big group. 
Walk 1 connection away. All things connected to another thing of the same type are in a group. 
Lets say all valves are connected to a junction or a heating coil - i'd have two groups.
buildings can be fully connected. 
I do this process again and again, keeping track of all groups. 
groups end where the connection types diverge. 
can choose what relationships are important to consider for making my groups.
Just cnx and type, or cnx and type and property maybe. 

Not sure if I should care about cardinality. Is a junction connecting to 3 things meaningfully different than one connecting to 5 things. 
This process is for visualizing the building and as a helpful view for creating queries, it isn't for speeding up query runtime

This is not working well ... 

Maybe borrow ideas of lean graphs and then create groups based on class and connected class. 
Lean just means that there are no redundant triples in a graph. 
For this case it may be better just to define the relations of interest and maybe the ontologies used for classes. 
Could also specifically be interested in the classes.
