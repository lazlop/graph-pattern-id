When a `Junction` is used, what might have been modeled as a single, branched `Connection` 
is separated into three or more separate connections, all tied together with the `Junction` and its associated connection points. 

`Junction` is a subClassOf `Connectable`, which gives it the ability to have connection points, but unlike Equipment (and like Connection) 
it is not allowed to change the Medium that passes through it. This is why `Junction` is a sibling class to `Equipment` and not a subclass.
This constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Junction` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple
validation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents. See {s223:Substance-Medium} for

For instance, to denote the concentration of a Substance in a Medium, `ofSubstance` is used. Typically, there's also an `ofMedium` relation between the observed `Property` and the Medium, (see Figures 10-9 and 10-10). For example, to represent the concentration of CO2 in air, we use `ofSubstance` to relate to CO2 and `ofMedium` to relate to air. The term `ofSubstance` is broad enough to include situations where a sensor is used to detect constituents that should not be present in a medium, such as ammonia in air. Therefore, `ofSubstance` is used to indicate the substance of interest, while `ofConstituent` would indicate a constituent that is normally present in the composition of the mix." .

`Substance-Medium` is also the root of the medium hierarchy that is used to ensure compatibility of different medium designations. For example,
`Fluid-Water` and `Water-ChilledWater` are alternative but compatible ways of identifying what is flowing in a pipe, using different degrees of
specificity. `Water-ChilledWater` and `Water-HotWater` are not compatible. Compatibility is determined by testing if one medium is a subclass of the
other. This gets a bit more complicated in the case of mixtures, where at least one of the constituents of a mixture must be compatible with at least one of
the constituents of the other medium. 

Testing for medium compatibility is done in the context of entities that have a `hasMedium` relation, such as 

* `Connection` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s. See {s223:Connection}.

* `Junction` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s See {s223:Junction}.

If a `Sensor` observes a `QuantifiableObservableProperty` relative to a unique
or specified reference point, it can be modeled with an observation location and
a reference location, and indicating the difference between two values by setting `isDeltaQuantity` to `true`. For example:
```

        s223:hasObservationLocation :location1 ;

EnumerationKinds define the (closed) set of permissible values for a given purpose. 
For example, the DayOfWeek `EnumerationKind` enumerates the days of the week and allows no other values.

EnumerationKinds are arranged in a class hierarchy tree, with the root class named `EnumerationKind`. Each subclass is named 
starting with its immediate superclass, followed by a hyphen and a name that is unique among the sibling classes. 
Each class is also an instance of itself. This unusual modeling pattern was used to achieve:

- The ability to set an EnumerationKind value that is more general, or not yet fully specified 
at the time of modeling, such as s223:Electricity-AC without having to state exactly what voltage or frequency it is.

- The ability to use the sh:class SHACL predicate at any level in the EnumerationKind hierarchy 
to constrain a value in the s223 specification, even if it is a more general one such as s223:Electricity-AC in the above example.

Certain validation constraints exist in the standard that evaluate compatibility of EnumerationKinds. 
Two values are deemed compatible if they are the same, if one is a direct ancestor (or descendant) of the other, 
or if they are mixtures sharing at least one constituent.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """`Equipment` is the modeling construct used to represent a thing designed to accomplish a specific task, or a complex thing
that contains component pieces of `Equipment` that are connected to each other and work together to accomplish a task. `Equipment` can have
`Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s through which one or more kinds of medium (see {s223:Substance-Medium}) might flow. Examples of possible `Equipment` include a `Pump`,
`Fan`, `HeatExchanger`, `Luminaire`, and `Sensor`, as well as more complex things like a heat pump, a chilled water plant, or a utility meter.
`Equipment` is distinct from a `System`, which is simply a logical grouping or collection of (only) `Equipment`.

In common usage, terms like equipment and system have a variety of ambiguous and possibly conflicting interpretations. A semantic model is
an attempt to eliminate such ambiguities and conflicts. If the thing being modeled involves `Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s, it must be modeled as
`Equipment` and not a `System`. Thus, a model of a chilled water plant that includes external connections to things beyond the plant must
be modeled as `Equipment`. Any contained `Equipment` within the chilled water plant (i.e., the pumps, valves, filters, and other things) may alternatively or in
addition be logically grouped and modeled as a `System`.

The graphical depiction of Equipment used in this document is a round-cornered
rectangle as shown in Figure 5-1.
